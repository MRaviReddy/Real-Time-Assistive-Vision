# Real-Time Assistive Vision (RealSense or Video Upload)
# Assistive Technology for Blind and Visually Impaired
  (BVI) Individuals Using Deep Learning
/* Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) individuals (Divyangjan) encounter numerous difficulties in
mobility and performing daily life activities independently. Though assistive technologies have
made significant strides over the past decades, a major issue remains with designs that address the
specific need of the BVI population concerning rare situations, particularly in circumstances of
poor illumination. The recent advances in AI, deep learning, and computer vision technologies
have opened new avenues for consideration to enhance the independence and quality of life of
people with visual disabilities. This literature reviews the most advanced technologies in computer
vision, deep learning models of various approaches as well as assistive devices, targeting the real
problems of the BVI population. Based on a review of some cutting-edge work, the paper
describes several major gaps in the solutions available and proposes an integrated vision for a
system. The suggested system merges novel low-light enhancement techniques, real-time objectdetection algorithms, and natural auditory feedback modalities. These innovative set of solutions
will enable the BVI portion of the population within the region to easily apply various costeffective navigation solutions to enhance mobility with safety and independence in diverse
conditions. It is, therefore, concluded that there is an immense need for a variety of mobility
technologies that should be made easily available to BVI individuals since these will surely
improve their independence and quality of life. */

Overview :
â”œâ”€â”€ blind.py
â”œâ”€â”€ lowlight_test.py # testing code
â”œâ”€â”€ lowlight_train.py # training code
â”œâ”€â”€ model.py # Zero-DEC network
â”œâ”€â”€ dataloader.py
â”œâ”€â”€ snapshots
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Epoch99.pth #  A pre-trained snapshot (Epoch99.pth)
```
### Test: 

cd Zero-DCE_code
```
python lowlight_test.py 
```
The script will process the images in the sub-folders of "test_data" folder and make a new folder "result" in the "data". You can find the enhanced images in the "result" folder.

### Train: 
1) cd Zero-DCE_code

2) download the training data <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GAB3uGsmAyLgtDBDONbil08vVu5wJcG3/view?usp=sharing">google drive</a> or <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/11-u_FZkJ8OgbqcG6763XyA">baidu cloud [password: 1234]</a>

3) unzip and put the  downloaded "train_data" folder to "data" folder
```
python lowlight_train.py 
```

```
AFTER MODEL TRAINING 
```
## STREAMLIT RUN
streamlit run blind.py
The python script will run on streamlit and displays a interface of Real Time Assistive Technology and then start the assistive vision on clicking the button.Then their appears the real video ,enhanced video,Yolov8 detection,faster RCNN detection and Real time text to speech generation in multiple languages...
